# TellaJoke

This repository contains an Android Application which is part of an exercise for the Developing Android Apps  Nanodegree at Udacity. 

The starter code can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud867/tree/master/FinalProject) along with the instructions and some brief info about the project.

## Application  Overview
In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules:

1. A Java library that provides jokes
2. A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
3. An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
4. An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display

**The final product will look like this.**
